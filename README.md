# Disk_Scheduling_project
I made this Project using C language. This project implements various disk scheduling algorithms in the C programming language to optimize the order in which disk I/O requests are serviced. The goal is to minimize seek time and improve overall system performance. The program simulates how an operating system handles disk requests using different strategies, allowing comparison of their efficiency.
The project helps in understanding:
1.How disk scheduling impacts system efficiency.
2.Trade-offs between fairness and performance.
3.Practical application of operating system concepts in C.
